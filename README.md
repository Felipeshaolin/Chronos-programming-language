<h2>Chronos-programming-language</h2>
<p>the Chronos programming language is a simple, assembly-like programming language currently in development.</p>
<p>Chronos is a hobby project that is currently only maintened by me. It is in it's earliest form, currently the only way to execute Chronos code is by using the prototype python interpreter that is featured in the "python source" folder, this interpreter will not be maintained tho.</p>
