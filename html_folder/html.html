    <h2>

      <p> what is chronos</p>

    </h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chronos is my first programming language. It was started as a joke, and was never meant to be fast or have good syntax. I based myself in assembly because it was the most simple type of code I could imagine, and the first prototype interpreter was created in about a week using Python. </p>

    <h2>all commands:</h2>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here are all commands that are already included in Chronos. The details of how to make you own commands will be after this section.</p>
    
    <p class="smaller">memory values may be called 'bytes' but they do not occupy one byte of memory.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Addition</button>
    <div class="panel">
    
      <p>add</p>
      <p>[memory adress or value](value 01 and 02){two bytes}</p>
      <p>adds two values together, it adds the hold 
                           register with the value or memory adress given
                           and the result goes to the hold register</p>
      <p class="not_white">easter egg</p>
      <p>aadd</p>
      <p>(value 05) {one byte} # single-cycle</p>
      <p>adds two values together, it adds the hold 
                           register with the value in the a register and

    <h2>things to note:</h2>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chronos is a simple language, it can be used for simple code. and new operations can be written easily as the source code is very flexible. here are the main structures you need to know to code in chronos and eventually make you own commands:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        
        <p><b>memory and registers:</b></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the memory is chosen by the user before execution of code and cannot be less than 30 "bytes" long. it follows the same rules real memory would: the first 3 "bytes" are reserved for the 3 register</p>
        <ul>

          <p>program counter (address #02)</p>
          <p>register that holds a pointer to the operation
            that will be executed.
            counts up with every operation.(with some exceptions (jumps and gotos)).</p>
          <p>hold register (address #01)</p>

          <p>resgister that stores any value, it is used
            as ram to store operations.</p>

          <p>A$ (adress #00)</p>
          <p>register that can hold any info, can be 
            changed by all intructions that start by 
            "a" or by just messing with it's address.</p>
        </ul>

        <p>then the other bytes that follow are the actual code. so be careful when writing to memory or using gotos.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

        <p><b>difference between memory addressed and valued commands:</b></p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the presence of a "#" character is what indicates the interpreter that the value input is an address. It will fetch the value in the index of that value to be used in the operation. </p>

        <p>operations that can use adresses will always have two values. The smaller is for the function that handles addresses and the next is used for values.</p>

      </li>
      
      <li>

        <p><b>how to make your own commands:</b></p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the first you will want to do is download the source code for the interpreter. in it you will find a file named 'back_end' and in it you will find a lot of necessary functions</p>

        <ul>
          <p><b>deciffer_file()</b></p>
          <p>it is responsable for reading the file and putting indexes of each intruction into the memory (global_memory list).in it you will find a line that compares the index of the word variable with a list of values. if you plan to write a single cycle intruction this line will need to altered because it dictates if a function is single cycle or not. just add the value of your function there and the function will work normally.</p>

          <p><b>a function for every command</b></p>
          <p>it's here that you will code you own command, for your disposition are 3 pointers that make code more readable:</p>

          <ul>

            <p><b>a,hold and pc_register_pointer</b></p>
            <p>these variables will always have the value of the index of memory where the registers are stored</p>

            
            <p><b>the boolian variables debug_mode and discreet_mode</b></p>
            <p> will be true when the respective mode is activated.</p>

          </ul>

          <p> it is always useful to look at the standard functions to understand better how everything works together</p>

        </ul>

      </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>future additions:</h2>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chronos is a project that is coded by a single person, me. as it is, the prototype is promising, speed is an issue because of the use of an interpreted language (python) to run interpreted code. But a future version of the chronos interpreter will be made in c++. I may add extra I/O functions as i feel that Chronos lacks the same capabilities as other programming languages. So a function that opens files will maybe come after this.</p>
